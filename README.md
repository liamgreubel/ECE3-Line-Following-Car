# ECE3-Line-Following-Car
Developed on Energia (TI's version of Arduino) for the TI-RSLK robot car.  The car has 8 IR sensors that emit and collect IR light from a black line track with
a gradient, where the center of the line is darkest and the edge of the line is light grey.  Using PID feedback control, the car is able to follow the line, turn around, drive back and stop at a target in under a certain time.  For extra credit, the on-board buttons were used to reset the car for different trial runs.
